        "\n",
        "## 🚀 Overview\n",
        "This prototype is an integrated AI diagnostic assistant designed to bridge the gap between raw patient vitals and actionable clinical intervention. It combines a Machine Learning predictive engine with a Generative AI summarization layer to provide healthcare professionals with instant, data-backed patient risk assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🎯 Motive\n",
        "Physicians are overwhelmed by raw data. The goal of this project is to reduce cognitive load and diagnostic time. By pinpointing exactly *which* biomarkers are driving a patient's risk, we can transition from reactive treatment to proactive, personalized preventative care.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🧠 Architecture & Integration\n",
        "Unlike traditional models that just output a \"Risk %\", this prototype utilizes a dual-engine approach:\n",
        "1. **The ML Engine (Predictive):** A Random Forest Classifier analyzes clinical metrics to predict diabetes risk (achieving 97.10% accuracy on the test set). It extracts feature importances to identify the specific physiological drivers of that risk (e.g., HbA1c, BMI).\n",
        "2. **The GenAI Engine (Generative):** The system dynamically ingests the ML's top identified risk factors and generates a prioritized, human-readable Clinical Action Plan for the attending physician.\n",
        "\n",
        "## ⚖️ Ethics, Bias, and Limitations\n",
        "* **The \"Co-Pilot\" Principle:** This tool is strictly a clinical *decision-support* system, not a replacement for human judgment. All generated reports explicitly mandate human clinical review.\n",
        "* **Algorithmic Bias:** The model's accuracy relies on the diversity of the training data. Future iterations will require continuous auditing to ensure minority demographics are not disproportionately misclassified.\n",
        "* **Data Privacy:** In a production environment, all patient data would be anonymized and processed using HIPAA-compliant, zero-retention API endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 💼 Business Feasibility\n",
        "This prototype is highly scalable as a B2B SaaS product for mid-sized clinics and telemedicine platforms.\n",
        "* **Revenue Model:** Tiered subscription based on API calls (patient assessments per month) or integration fees for existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.\n",
        "* **Value Proposition:** Reduces physician chart-review time, lowers hospital readmission rates through early intervention, and standardizes preliminary patient screening."
